# PHP-CRUD-Operations
This is a basic PHP crud project by using SQL database. 
Here I'm giving an example web "Quote Talks".
In which these all are the functionality
Register User - Login - Logout
User can explore some Quotes as well as they can add their own Quote too.
This project is developed using HTML, CSS and PHP for the back-end actions.
